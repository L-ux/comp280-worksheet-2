Base repository for COMP280 worksheet 2
## Unity project is called 'Pacman thing'
it aint perfect... 
WASD controls ...

- Blinky (Red) - Hunts you directly at all times
- Pinky (Pink) - Tried to ambush by aiming for location in front of you
- Inky (Blue) - Roams around random waypoints, then hunts you when you get too close. Goes back to roaming when too far from you
- Clyde (Beige?) - Roams aroud random waypoint, but runs away if you get too close.

They definitely aren't perfect, but they work (most of the time)

There is currently no way to win, but you can still lose :)
