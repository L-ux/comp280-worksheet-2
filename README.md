## Unity project is called 'Pacman thing'
it aint perfect
WASD controls

- Blinky (Red) - Hunts you directly at all times
- Pinky (Pink) - Tried to ambush by aiming for location in front of you
- Inky (Blue) - Roams around random waypoints, then hunts you when you get too close. Goes back to roaming when too far from you
- Clyde (Beige?) - Roams aroud random waypoint, but runs away if you get too close.
They definitely aren't perfect, but they work (most of the time)
